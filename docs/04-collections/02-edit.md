Modify a collection as you gather feedback:

- Swap or reorder Audios to change the emotional arc.
- Pair worlds and orbiters differently to open new interactions.
- Refresh guidance notes or visuals so explorers stay oriented.

Edits keep collections responsive to how xPlorers actually move through them.
