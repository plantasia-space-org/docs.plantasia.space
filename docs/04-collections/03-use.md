xPlorers navigate and explore collections in flexible ways:

- Enter at the start for the intended journey or jump to specific pairings of worlds and orbiters.
- Save or share regenerations that happen inside the collection.
- Remix by swapping in different Audios or orbiters if the collection allows open configuration.

Use these signals to keep collections alive and aligned with the community.
