Release is the single flow to assemble and publish a collection:

1. Choose the Audios, worlds, and orbiters that belong together.
2. Define the order or pathways that guide explorers, and add notes about the intended experience.
3. Confirm all elements are published and accessible, then set visibility and any collaboration credits.
4. Publish so xPlorers can enter and begin regenerating sound inside the curated flow.

Monitor engagement signals and iterate the collection as explorers respond.
