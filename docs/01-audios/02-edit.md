Refine or update an Audio whenever details change:

- Update titles, descriptions, and tags so explorers understand the intent.
- Swap or upload improved versions while keeping the Audio link stable.
- Adjust regenerative notes to guide how others can reshape the sound.

Edits help keep the Audio relevant as it travels across worlds and collections.
