## What you can edit

You can update:

- Title and artist information
- Cover image
- Assigned Entangled World (for preview and context)
- Assigned Orbiter (for preview)
- Metadata, description, story, and credits
- Privacy, distribution, and licensing settings

## Iteration mindset

Audios are meant to evolve.

You can revisit an Audio to improve its description, adjust visuals, or refine how it is presented to other xPlorers, release new audio versions.

## Save and publish changes

Save drafts while iterating, this wont be released till you explicit press release audio.

Publish updates when you want changes to apply to the public version of the Audio.
