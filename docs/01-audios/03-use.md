Audios behave differently depending on where they are used:

- In entangled worlds, Audios react to movement, physics, and the visual language of the world.
- With orbiters, Audios are stretched, filtered, or re-sequenced through playful controls.
- Inside collections, Audios are sequenced with worlds and orbiters to create curated journeys.

Track how an Audio is performing across placements and iterate as explorers regenerate it.
