## Using Audios

Audios can be listened to directly in normal audio player ![Play audio](https://plantasia-prod-public.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/docs/en/media/audios/play.png)
 or explored through Orbiters ![orbiter-on](https://plantasia-prod-public.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/docs/en/media/audios/orbiter-on.png)
.
You can open an Audio from the homepage, search results, collections, or world views.

## Playback and looping

Audios can be played using the standard audio player.

You can:

- Play, pause, and stop
- Seek to a position
- Loop the entire track or a selected region

Looping allows focused listening and prepares the Audio for transformation.

## Exploring with Orbiters

See [orbiters](/en/docs/orbiters/use) section for more details. 

Audios can be opened inside an Orbiter.

Orbiters allow you to transform sound through movement, dimensions, and modulation.

The same Audio can behave very differently depending on the Orbiter and the Entangled World.

## Context through Entangled Worlds

Every Audio lives inside an Entangled World.

The world defines the visual and narrative context in which the Audio is experienced.

## Looking ahead

Audios can also be part of **Collections**, where they are combined with other Audios, Worlds, and Orbiters into longer listening journeys.
