Release is where a new Audio is created and published in one flow:

1. Upload or record the sound you want to share.
2. Add context such as title, description, tags, and regenerative notes.
3. Confirm ownership and intent, then select where the Audio should appear first (standalone, inside a world, or in a collection).
4. Publish so orbiters and worlds can begin transforming it.

After release, you can update the Audio without breaking existing placements across plantasia.space.
