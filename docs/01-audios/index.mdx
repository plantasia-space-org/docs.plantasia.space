:::info Audios
Audios are the base elements of regenerative music inside plantasia.space.
:::

An Audio can be a **sample**, a **loop**, or a **full release track**. Most importantly, it can be a finished piece of music published so others can recreate it, remix it, and regenerate it into new forms.

The audios are shared to be listened to, and to evolve through exploration, transformation and reuse into regenerative music. 

## Where Audios live

Each Audio belongs to an **Entangled World** by default, and can be played in other worlds depending on the permissions of who is playing. 

The world provides the visual, narrative, and contextual space in which the Audio is explored.

When you upload an audio, you need to set a default **Orbiters** that transform the Audio through interaction, this audio also can be played in other Orbiters depending on the permissions of who is playing.
