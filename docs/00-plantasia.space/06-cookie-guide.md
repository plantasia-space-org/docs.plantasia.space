# Cookie Guide

At plantasia.space, we view our platform as an "organic software" growing between a perfect garden and a jungle. To keep this ecosystem healthy and functional, we use cookies—small text files stored on your device.

We believe in transparency and user choice. You are in control of which cookies you allow, with the exception of those strictly necessary for the site to function.

## How We Use Cookies

We categorize our cookies into two simple types:

### 1. The Essentials (Necessary)

Just like a plant needs roots, our platform needs these cookies to survive. They are always active and cannot be turned off because the site would break without them.

*   **What they do:** They handle your secure login, keep your session active, and ensure payments work correctly (via our partner, Paddle).
*   **Your experience:** You won't notice them, but they are working in the background to keep your account safe and your transactions secure.

### 2. Growth & Understanding (Analytics)

These cookies help us understand how the "garden" is being used so we can prune and water the right spots.

*   **What they do:** We use tools like Google Analytics to see which pages are popular and how visitors navigate the site.
*   **Your choice:** These are optional. They are disabled by default until you explicitly say "Yes." If you turn them on, you help us improve the experience for everyone.

> **Note:** We do not use "Marketing" or advertising cookies. Your data is not being sold to advertisers.

## Your Control Center

You can manage your cookie preferences at any time using the controls below:

import { CookiePreferences } from '@site/src/components/CookieConsent';

<CookiePreferences />

When you first visit, you will see a banner at the bottom of the screen inviting you to choose your preference.

*   **Accept All:** Turns on both Essential and Analytics cookies.
*   **Only Necessary:** Keeps only the Essential cookies active. Analytics remain off.
*   **Preferences:** Opens a detailed menu where you can toggle Analytics on or off individually.
*   **Changing Your Mind:** You are never locked into a choice. You can update your preferences at any time via the settings menu.
