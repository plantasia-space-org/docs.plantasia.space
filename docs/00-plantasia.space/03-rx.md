# Manifesto

plantasia.space starts from the idea that music is not a product but a living process: something that transforms, is shared, regenerates, and returns to the landscape it came from. Every sound is a seed entrusted to the community; every listen is a creative gesture that changes the world.

The philosophy behind this project connects to Acoustic Ecology. As R. Murray Schafer reminds us—we hear the acoustic environment as a musical composition and we share responsibility for its shaping.

Sound is understood as an evolving organism.  
It is not about repeating, but reimagining.  
Not about consuming, but relating.  
Not about separating nature and humanity, but listening to ourselves as part of the same **Landscape**.

1. Change is the only constant, repetition is also possible.  
2. Being wrong is also okay.  
3. Expect finding music in Soundscape and soundscape in Music.  
4. Out of tune can be beautiful; each body, organ, cell, and organism has different resonant frequencies.  
5. The octave has 12 pitches, and infinite pitches at the same time.  
6. The tempo does not always have to be the same, also it can always be the same.  
7. Practice deep listening to truly immerse yourself in the music and understand its power.  
8. Stay true to yourself, and let your individuality shine through in your music.  
9. UnderPop: Embrace the underground and the lesser-known, and be open to the beauty that lies in pop culture.  
10. Forget the genre, enjoy the Style.

## An aural community—in simple terms

The idea of an **acoustic community** helps us understand how a shared world of sound is built.  
Simply put: a group of people shares a listening experience in the same environment—physical, digital, or both—and that experience shapes how they relate to each other and the landscape.

This model has two complementary lenses:

### 1. The micro view: sound and its context
A sound does not exist alone.  
Its meaning depends on:

- what surrounds it,  
- who listens,  
- what the listener remembers, imagines, or interprets,  
- and how that sound relates to the landscape.

From this perspective, each listening session is a small composition. What we hear mediates our relationship with the environment: it can speak about ourselves, others, or the soundscape itself.

### 2. The macro view: the community and its relationships
At a wider level, an acoustic community is not only about information traveling from sender to receiver.  
It is about how sound:

- **creates bonds**,  
- **sustains relationships**,  
- **shapes behaviors**,  
- and **reactivates auditory awareness**.

When a community listens actively, it also creates. And by creating, it changes the soundscape it inhabits.


## What does this mean for an Aural Community?

An **Aural Community** extends this idea: a space where:

- music is not linear,  
- sound can transform in real time,  
- user-creators participate actively,  
- and technology supports imagination, not replaces it.

It integrates concepts from:

- acoustic ecology,  
- soundscape design,  
- game audio design,  
- generative music,  
- artificially creative musical systems,  
- and new musical interfaces.

Instead of a consumption system, it proposes an **ecosystem of co-creation**.

plantasia.space implements this vision by letting each person:

- publish audios,  
- create entangled worlds,  
- design orbiters,  
- and turn listening into a creative act.

## A community born from listening

Nothing here is fixed.  
Each sound changes when someone listens; each world shifts when someone visits.  
The community is created in that movement.

By listening, we transform the landscape.  
By creating, we regenerate it.  
And by participating, we make it shared.
