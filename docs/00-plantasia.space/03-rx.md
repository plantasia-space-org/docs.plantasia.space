- Release sounds with the intent that they can be explored, remixed, and regenerated.
- Design entangled worlds that welcome playful movement and sensory discovery.
- Build orbiters that translate motion and curiosity into new sonic forms.
- Share collections that invite others to participate, not just observe.
- Keep plantasia.space open, lowercase, and evolving through collaboration.
