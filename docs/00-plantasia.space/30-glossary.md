### Acoustic Community
An acoustic community is defined as an aggregation of species that produce sound using internal or external sound-producing mechanisms. These communities occur in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial environments.  
An acoustic community is the **biophonic** component of a soundscape and is characterized by its acoustic signature — the distribution of sonic information in amplitude and frequency. Distinct acoustic communities can be identified by habitat, frequency range, time of day, or season.  
Acoustic communities can also serve as a proxy for biodiversity richness.

### Aural Community
An Aural Community is conceived with the user-creator at its center: a system of procedural (non-linear) music and sound that combines the creativity of artists and user-creators with the platform’s developments. It enables unique sound works at every moment, seeking the co-creation of a meaningful and singular listening experience.  
This community brings together concepts and tools from acoustic ecology, soundscape studies, game audio design, generative music, artificially creative musical systems, and new interfaces for musical expression.

### Certificate of Authenticity
A document that authenticates a piece of artwork. In digital contexts, it verifies that a program or object is a genuine, legal copy.


### ENT (Entangled Token)
An ENT is neither purely physical nor purely digital — it is both. Entangled Tokens exist simultaneously as unique physical objects and as unique digital records on the blockchain (NFT). This hybrid existence is interconnected from its creation through a certificate of authenticity linking both worlds.  
Each ENT is associated with a sister project focused on promoting biodiversity regeneration or enhancing the well-being of Earth’s inhabitants.


### ENT Cards
A new paradigm for independent music distribution, merging physical and digital releases — connecting music making, listening, and ownership.


### ENT Worlds
A network of interconnected sonic planets and objects existing at the intersection of digital and physical worlds.


### Landscape
We use “Landscape” instead of “nature” because in many cultures nature is defined as everything that is not human. “Landscape” allows us to describe an environment that is not separate from people, but part of the same continuum.


### NFC
NFC (Near Field Communication) is a technology that enables fast, short-range data exchange between devices. It is used to store, write, and read digital information inside ENT Cards.


### Orbiters
An initiative exploring the intersection of digital and physical worlds through intelligent music players and meta-musical instruments.  
Orbiters form a global network of intelligent music tools that use algorithmic approaches to support listening and creation, allowing users to shape their sound in new ways. These tools are designed to be accessible regardless of musical training and aim to reactivate auditory awareness while expanding the possibilities of musical exploration.


### plantasia.space
plantasia.space is a platform designed for regenerative music — sounds published with the intention that audiences can listen to, recreate, and transform them into new forms. Inside plantasia.space, you can publish sounds, place them inside entangled worlds — artistic representations of physical worlds — and use orbiters — spaceships that transform sound in different ways — to explore and regenerate those sounds, encouraging playful interaction and healthy sensory exploration.


### Regenerative Music
Regenerative music is music conceived and published with the intention that it can be listened to or recreated by the audience into new forms and aesthetics.  
It promotes the use of cycles and frequencies found in the landscape, creating harmonies with the cycles of the multiverse.  
Anything that sounds — if released with intention — can be music.


### Soundscape
A soundscape is an environment of sound (or sonic environment) with emphasis on how it is perceived and understood by an individual or by a society. It depends on the relationship between the listener and the environment, and may refer to actual physical environments or abstract constructions such as musical compositions or montage.
