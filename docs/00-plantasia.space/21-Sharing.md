Public audio can use private or shared Worlds, Orbiters, and Collections.
Audio visibility is the main rule for sharing.

## How Sharing and Permissions Work

plantasia space uses two simple models to control access and collaboration:

- **Audio uses a visibility (audience) model** — focused on listening and release permissions
- **Worlds, Orbiters, and Collections use a collaboration privacy model** — focused on editing, publishing, and teamwork

## Audio Visibility (Audience)

When you publish audio, you choose who can play and discover it:

- **Private** — only you can access it
- **Shared** — anyone with the audio link can view it
- **Public** — fully public and discoverable

This controls playback and distribution.

## Entangled World, Orbiter, and Collection Permissions

These use a collaboration model to decide:

- Who can access the entity directly
- Who can contribute and what role they have

### Individual xPlorer Permissions

When you invite specific xPlorers, you can assign roles:

- **Viewer** — can view and experience
- **Publisher** — can publish content inside the entity
- **Editor** — can edit and manage the entity

### General Access (Link or Public Rules)

You can also define baseline access for everyone:

- **Restricted** — only invited xPlorers can access
- **Anyone with the link** — access via link with a selected role

Default roles for general access can be:

- Viewer
- Publisher
- Editor

This model is optimized for collaboration, contributions, and shared creation.

## Important Behavior

- Public audio can use private or shared Worlds, Orbiters, and Collections
- Audio visibility controls who can listen and discover the audio
- Entity privacy controls collaboration rights and direct access

## In Practice

You can:

- Keep a World private so only you can publish in it
- Release public audio that uses that private World
- Let listeners experience it through the audio

Others will not be able to open, edit, or publish inside that World unless you invite them.

### Simple Rule to Remember

**Audio controls who listens.**  
**Worlds, Orbiters, and Collections control who collaborates and publishes.**
