plantasia.space is a regenerative music platform born from the dream of creating a **borderless aural community**. It is a project initiated by **𝐵𝓇𝓊𝓃𝒶 𝒢𝓊𝒶𝓇𝓃𝒾𝑒𝓇𝒾**, developed over more than ten years, shaped by her experience in collectives such as **Exoplanetas**, **Head Brothers**, and **Aventuras Sonores**, where the exploration of sound, worlds, and imagination has always been a central thread.

Together with **Gabriel Vigliensoni**, electronic music artist, performer, and researcher working at the intersection of sound-making and machine learning, plantasia.space is shaped by a long-term collaboration that began in 2006. Their shared practice brings together artistic exploration, sound experimentation, and advanced research in music technology, forming a vision where creative practice meets technical innovation.

Here we propose a playground for listening and creation: a space where each xPlorer can launch sounds, publish them, place them inside **entangled worlds**, and transform them using **orbiters** — tools that invite play, exploration, and real-time regeneration of sound. Each audio is published so it can be listened to, re-created, and reshaped into new forms by the community.

plantasia.space is grounded in the idea that listening is not a passive act: it is a way of relating to others, to the environment, and to oneself. For this reason, the project aims to move away from a one-directional, consumption-driven listening experience, proposing instead an open, participatory, living practice where imagination and technology meet to form new sonic dimensions.

This project invites us to explore together, to create, and to regenerate possible worlds through sound, sustaining a community that values curiosity, play, and diverse ways of listening.
