plantasia.space is a platform for regenerative music — a space where xPlorers release sounds, place them inside entangled worlds, and reshape them through playful exploration. Every sound is shared with the intent that it can be listened to, recreated, and transformed into new forms.

Use this section to understand how the platform fits together and how each creative element supports regenerative music.
