# Intro

Welcome to the plantasia.space community: a space for music, landscape, creation, and collaboration.

## **Open Citizenship**

We encourage everyone to recognize how their actions affect others. plantasia.space aims to counteract inequality, discrimination, and abuses of power. Positive action is essential.

If you notice someone making an extra effort to ensure that the community is welcoming and accessible, we want to know.
