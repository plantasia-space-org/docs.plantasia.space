**How do I release a sound?**
Use the Audios > Create flow to publish a new sound, add its details, and prepare it for exploration.

**Where do sounds live?**
Audios can be placed inside entangled worlds and bundled into collections so they can be explored and reshaped.

**What are orbiters?**
Orbiters are spaceships that transform and play with sound as they move through a world, letting xPlorers regenerate Audios in real time.

**How do I share my work?**
Release your Audios, Worlds, Orbiters, or Collections to make them available to other xPlorers across plantasia.space.
