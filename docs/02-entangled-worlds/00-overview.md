Entangled Worlds are world-building spaces where sound, visuals, and narrative come together.

They are artistic representations of **real exoplanets**, designed to host Audios and give them spatial, visual, and story context.

## What an Entangled World does

An Entangled World connects:

- **A real exoplanet** (astronomical data and reference)
- **A world identity** (geography, flora, fauna, society, history)
- **Audios** (music and sound placed inside the world)
- **Orbiters** (the instruments used to explore and transform sound)

Together, these elements turn listening into exploration.

## Sections and structure

Each Entangled World is organized into sections:

- A **main** section that brings everything together
- **Geography**, **Flora**, **Fauna**, **Society**, and **DNA** sections

These sections act as visual and narrative anchors, helping communicate the identity of the world.

## What this section covers

- **Release**: create and publish a new Entangled World
- **Edit**: refine an existing world over time
- **Use**: explore worlds, place Audios, and navigate them with Orbiters
