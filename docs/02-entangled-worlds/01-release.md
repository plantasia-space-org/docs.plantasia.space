Releasing a world now includes its creation steps in a single flow:

1. Define the world concept and sensory palette (visuals, physics, atmosphere).
2. Add zones for Audios and set baseline rules for how orbiters move and respond.
3. Optimize assets so exploration feels responsive, then publish world notes explaining its intent.
4. Choose whether to launch with featured Audios or leave the world open for others to place their sounds.

Once released, you can continue iterating while keeping existing explorers in sync across plantasia.space.
