## Where to start

Go to **Release → New Entangled World**.

![New Entangled World](https://plantasia-prod-public.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/docs/en/media/worlds/new.png)

Depending on your user type, you can create a limited number of Entangled Worlds. Additional worlds can be added through add-ons.

Releasing a world opens a multi-step form.

## 1) Choose an exoplanet

Start by selecting a real exoplanet to entangle with your world.

You can:

- Pick from suggested or future exoplanets
- Search by name
- Search by number (for example, typing `95` will show planets with that number in their name)

You can change the selected exoplanet later.

## Exoplanet data

By expanding the information panel, you can see astronomical and physical measurements from the current exoplanet database.

At the moment, this data mainly affects Cosmic LFO behavior inside Orbiters. Choosing a planet is primarily an artistic and symbolic decision.

## 2) Name your world

Set a name for your Entangled World.

If you need inspiration, you can generate a name by selecting a biological kingdom:

- Plantae
- Fungi
- Animalia

The generated name can be edited later.

## 3) Worldbuilding elementals

Worldbuilding Elementals define the identity of your world.

They describe:

- Geography
- Flora
- Fauna
- Society
- History

You can:

- Apply a preset
- Randomize all values
- Define each element manually

These values are later used to generate visuals and narration.

## 4) Elemental Matrix

The Elemental Matrix places your world between **water, fire, earth, and air**.

This influences visual generation and creates six world sections:

- Main
- Geography
- Flora
- Fauna
- Society
- DNA

## Save draft or continue

After completing the first step, you can save the world as a draft or continue to the next step.

## 5) Planet texture generation

In the second step, you can generate or regenerate the planet texture.

Select one of the available AI models and guide the generation using:

- Art medium
- Art technique
- Color palette
- Lighting style

Each world includes a limited number of texture credits based on your subscription. You can top up with texture credit packs if needed.

## 6) Scene and atmosphere

On desktop, you can open the world in fullscreen to adjust scene parameters:

- Starfield presets
- Background colors
- Number of moons (up to 247)
- Moon textures and colors
- World size and detail
- Halo (color and size)
- Clouds (texture, color, opacity, movement)
- Lighting (ambient, surface, direction X/Y/Z)

## 7) Narration and story

You can write narration for the world, including:

- Introduction
- Geography
- Flora
- Fauna
- Society
- History
- Conclusion

You can also use assisted writing tools to generate or translate stories using different tones, formats, and languages.

## 8) Collaboration and access

Define who can:

- View the world
- Publish Audios inside the world
- Edit the world

You can also set general access rules (private, link-based, or open).

## 9) Draft and release

Save your world as a draft while iterating.

Release the world when you are ready for it to be explored and used by others.
