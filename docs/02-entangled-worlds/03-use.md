Entangled worlds host Audios and respond during exploration:

- Place Audios to define how sound is distributed across spaces or zones.
- Guide orbiters through paths that reveal new layers, stems, or effects.
- Observe how explorers interact and adjust world parameters to shape their experience.

World analytics help you understand which areas resonate and where to iterate next.
