## Using Entangled Worlds

At the moment, Entangled Worlds are primarily used through **Audios**.

When you work with a track, you can select which Entangled World it belongs to. This selection defines the visual, narrative, and contextual space in which the Audio will be explored.

## Worlds and tracks

Each Audio lives inside an Entangled World.

From the track view, you can:

- See which Entangled World the Audio is assigned to
- Switch between different sections of the world
- Navigate the Audio through the world’s structure

The Entangled World provides a spatial and narrative frame for listening.

## World sections

Entangled Worlds are divided into sections that represent different aspects of the world:

- Main
- Geography
- Flora
- Fauna
- Society
- DNA

When listening to a track, you can move between these sections to experience different visual and narrative contexts connected to the same Audio.

## Listening and exploration

As you navigate a track through an Entangled World, the world acts as a container for exploration rather than a static background.

The visuals, narration, and world structure support a deeper listening experience and prepare the context for sound transformation using Orbiters.

## Relationship with Orbiters

See Orbiters Section for more details. 

Orbiters are used to actively explore and transform sound inside Entangled Worlds.

While the Entangled World defines the context, Orbiters define the interaction. Together, they turn listening into an exploratory process.

## Looking ahead

In future versions, Entangled Worlds will also be used inside **Collections**, including mixed collections that combine multiple worlds, Audios, and Orbiters.

This will allow worlds to be experienced not only per track, but as part of longer curated journeys.
