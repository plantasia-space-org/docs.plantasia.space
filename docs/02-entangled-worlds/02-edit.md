Adjust a world's properties and artistic elements as it evolves:

- Update visuals, lighting, and physics to change how Audios feel.
- Refine interaction points where orbiters trigger or reshape sound.
- Tweak world rules to keep exploration smooth and surprising.

Edits can be published gradually to keep explorers engaged without disrupting existing journeys.
