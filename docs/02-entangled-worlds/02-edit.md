## What you can edit

You can update:

- World name
- Worldbuilding elementals
- Elemental Matrix position
- Planet textures
- Scene and atmosphere settings
- Narration and story sections
- Collaboration and access rules

## Iteration mindset

Entangled Worlds are designed to evolve.

You can revisit a world, regenerate textures, rewrite narration, or adjust visuals as your ideas develop.

## Save and publish changes

Save drafts while experimenting.

Publish updates when you want changes to apply to the public version of the world.
