Orbiters are instruments you *play*.

They transform sound in real time, letting xPlorers explore Audios inside Entangled Worlds through movement, gesture, and modulation.

## What an Orbiter does

An Orbiter connects three things:

- **An Audio** (what you listen to)
- **An Entangled World** (the context you explore)
- **An Orbiter** (the instrument that transforms sound)

When an Orbiter is open, you can:

- **Play and loop** the Audio
- **Move in three axes (X, Y, Z)** to transform the sound
- **Switch dimensions (1 / 2 / 3)** to access different transformation setups
- **Add modulation** using the Cosmic LFO per axis

## Dimensions

Each Orbiter contains **three dimensions**.

Dimensions are not “presets”. Each dimension can map **X, Y, and Z** to different audio processes designed by the Orbiter creator.

Some controls are global (for example: **transport**, **loop**, and often **volume**). Most performance controls (XYZ, Cosmic LFO, sensors) are **dimension-specific**.

## What this section covers

- **Release**: create and publish a new Orbiter
- **Edit**: update an existing Orbiter after it’s been created
- **Use**: play an Orbiter on an Audio and explore its dimensions
