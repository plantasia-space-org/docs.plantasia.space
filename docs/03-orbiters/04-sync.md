Sync lets Orbiters play **together on one shared tempo** — several Orbiters on the same screen, or
Orbiters opened by different people in the same session. Turn it on and they lock to the same beat;
change the tempo from any one of them and the others follow.

## Turning Sync on

Each Orbiter has a **SYNC** button.

- Turn SYNC on to join the shared tempo.
- The badge next to SYNC shows how many are playing together.
- Turn SYNC off and the Orbiter goes back to playing on its own.

Who sets the tempo follows one simple rule:

- The **first** Orbiter to turn SYNC on **starts the session at its own tempo**.
- Anyone who syncs **after** that **adopts the tempo that's already going** — you don't have to match
  it by hand, and joining never pushes your speed onto everyone else.
- Turning SYNC **off keeps your current tempo**: the Orbiter carries on at the speed it was just
  playing — it never jumps back to an older value. From there the tempo is yours again.

## Every player has a tempo

The **BPM number on each Orbiter is that player's tempo**. What it means depends on SYNC:

- **Synced** — the number **is the shared tempo**, one master clock for everyone. Set it **any way** —
  type a new BPM, use the speed control on a synced Orbiter, or send MIDI — and **every synced
  Orbiter follows**.
- **Not synced** — the number is **that player's own tempo**. Change it and only that Orbiter
  re-speeds (with Warp on you hear it stretch, like a pitch fader); it never moves the shared tempo
  or any other player.
- The change **holds**: a tempo only moves when you deliberately change it. Loading another Orbiter
  into the session never changes a tempo that's already playing.

## Warp — follow the tempo, or play free

Each Orbiter has a **Warp** switch (on by default), in the Playback panel.

Warp means **follow the tempo** — whichever tempo the player is on:

- **Warp on** — the Orbiter **stretches to its tempo**: the shared one when synced, its **own BPM
  number** when not. So even unsynced, the BPM number is a real speed control — turn it and the
  audio follows.
- **Warp off** — the Orbiter **plays at its natural recorded speed**, ignoring any tempo. Use this
  when you want one sound to run free.

| Your Orbiter | What you hear |
|---|---|
| SYNC off · Warp on | Follows its **own** BPM number — change it and the audio stretches |
| SYNC off · Warp off | Plays at its natural recorded speed |
| SYNC on · Warp on | Follows the **shared** tempo — stretched to lock with everyone |
| SYNC on · Warp off | Stays in the session but plays at its natural speed |

## Launch grid — start and jump on the bar

Next to SYNC, each Orbiter has a **launch grid** picker (**None** by default). Pick a grid — 1 bar,
4 bars… — and that player's starts and jumps land **on the beat**:

- **Play** comes in on a bar line: a **synced** player waits for the next shared bar (you see the
  countdown), an **unsynced** player (Warp on) starts right on its own nearest bar line.
- **Moving the playhead while playing** doesn't jump immediately — it waits and lands on the next
  bar, so the groove never stumbles. The countdown shows when.
- The grid is **per player**: each Orbiter keeps its own. To set several at once, **focus them
  together** and pick a grid — every focused player adopts it.
- Set it to **None** and everything is immediate again.

## Speed vs pitch

The Orbiter's speed control can work in two ways, and the **monitor** shows which unit is active:

- **Speed (%)** — changes the tempo as a straight percentage. +10% means 10% faster.
- **Pitch (semitones, st)** — changes speed in **musical steps**, like transposing a note. Semitones move
  the speed *more steeply* than a percentage, so a small move can change the BPM a lot (one octave up is
  twice the speed).

If a speed change feels bigger than you expected, check the monitor — you're likely in a **pitch**
(semitone) mode rather than a **speed** (%) mode.

## Same screen vs different people

- **Same screen** — several Orbiters open together lock with no setup; just turn SYNC on.
- **Different people / windows** — joining the same **room** lets everyone share one tempo across
  devices. Turn SYNC on after joining and you adopt the room's tempo.
