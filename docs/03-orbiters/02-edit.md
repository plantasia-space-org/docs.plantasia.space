Adjust an orbiter's behavior or visual design as you learn from explorers:

- Tweak modulation depths, trigger thresholds, or timing rules to refine feel.
- Update visuals and motion paths so the orbiter aligns with world aesthetics.
- Add or remove controls to keep interaction intuitive and focused on sound play.

Iteration keeps orbiters lively and aligned with the evolving worlds they navigate.
