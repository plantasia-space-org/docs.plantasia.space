title: Release
---

Release combines building and publishing an orbiter in one process:

1. Choose the core behaviors (filters, sequencing, spatialization, or generative rules) and design playful controls.
2. Test with sample Audios inside a world to tune responsiveness and balance.
3. Publish control maps and interaction notes so explorers know how to fly it.
4. Verify compatibility with key worlds and Audio formats, then make it discoverable for collections.

After release, keep evolving the orbiter while staying backward-compatible with worlds already using it.
