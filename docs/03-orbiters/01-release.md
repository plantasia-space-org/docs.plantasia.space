This page documents features that are still in development and will be available soon. Details may change as we continue building plantasia.space.

## Where to start

Go to **Release → New Orbiter**.

![New Orbiter](https://plantasia-prod-public.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/docs/en/media/orbiters/new.png)

The release form lets you define the Orbiter's **visual identity**, choose a **preview context**, and configure its **panel** and **engine** per dimension.

## 1) Orbiter image

Upload an image that will identify your Orbiter.

- You can upload your own design.
- You can generate an image using the regeneration button, then edit it.

Orbiter images are displayed in a **hexagonal frame**. If needed, open the guidelines to design for this shape.

## 2) Orbital Name

Set the **Orbital Name** — a unique name that identifies your Orbiter on the platform.

You can regenerate the name if you need a starting point.

## 3) Preview Audio and Entangled World

Choose an **Audio** and an **Entangled World** to preview your Orbiter while you design it.

This preview choice does **not** permanently bind the Orbiter to that Audio or World.

Use fullscreen when you need a clearer view while testing.

## 4) Panel (per dimension)

Think of the panel as the **spaceship controls**.

Orbiters support **three dimensions** (World 1, World 2, World 3). Each dimension has independent panel settings.

Typical panel settings include:

- Color preset
- Rounded corners
- Frame width
- Font
- Ring (enabled / color)
- Amplitude reaction (visible when an Audio is playing)
- Internal radius

### Copy / paste panel settings

Panel styling is **dimension-specific**.

If you want consistent styling across dimensions, use **copy / paste** for the panel. This applies only to panel styling, not to the engine.

## 5) Engine (per dimension)

The engine defines **how the Orbiter transforms sound**.

Each dimension has its own engine configuration and may offer different effects or reproduction types.

### Mapping: minimum / equilibrium / maximum

Each mapped control has three key points:

- **Minimum**: effect behavior at one extreme
- **Equilibrium**: the center point (usually a bypass / neutral state)
- **Maximum**: effect behavior at the opposite extreme

A useful strategy is to keep **equilibrium at 0** as a reliable “no effect” reference point.

## 6) Collaboration and visibility

Set who can:

- **View** the Orbiter
- **Publish** with the Orbiter
- **Edit** the Orbiter

You can also set general access rules (for example: anyone with the link can view / publish / edit).

By default, Orbiters are visible and searchable.

## 7) Draft vs release

- **Save draft** if you want to continue later.
- **Release** when you are ready to publish.

After release, you can reuse the Orbiter across different Audios and Entangled Worlds.
