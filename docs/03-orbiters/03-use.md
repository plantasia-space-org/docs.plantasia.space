Orbiters interact with worlds and reshape sound during exploration:

- Load an orbiter inside a world and select the Audios it will transform.
- Fly through zones to trigger filters, loops, or generative layers tied to world geometry.
- Record or capture regenerations to share with other xPlorers.

Use metrics from sessions to see which controls resonate and where to fine-tune responsiveness.
