### Each ENT Card Includes an NFC Chip

[NFC section](/docs/xplorer-guides/02-ent-cards/03-nfc.md) (Near Field Communication) is a technology designed to simplify and accelerate data exchange between devices. As an international transmission standard, NFC enables contactless data exchange over short distances of 1–4 cm.

Every NFC-enabled device, including smartphones and dedicated NFC readers, can read the information on an NFC chip. The information stored on the NFC chip can provide an enhanced experience associated with the card. With a dedicated NFC app like [NFC Tools](https://www.wakdev.com/en/apps.html), users can access metadata related to the NFT (non-fungible token) aspect of the card.

Place your [compatible device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NFC-enabled_mobile_devices) close to the card tag, and it will read the data on it. The NFC tag reader works best when the reading device is within 1.5 inches (4 centimeters) of the NFC tag.

### PC & MAC

Any NFC reader that supports the NTAG215 Chip can read the cards. Both PC and MAC users can find suitable hardware and software for this purpose in the market.

- **iOS 14 Update**: Includes a native NFC tag reader for iPhone 7, 8, and X models. Users can scan NFC tags without requiring a separate app.
- **Older iPhone Models**: Devices like iPhone 6 or earlier do not support NFC tag scanning, even with third-party apps.

For NFC tag scanning, ensure that the NFC tag reader is enabled in the Control Center of your iPhone.

#### Recommended NFC Apps for Android:
- **NXP Tag Writer**: A comprehensive NFC app from leading NFC chip manufacturer NXP for writing various data types onto NFC tags.
- **NFC TagInfo by NXP**: An app for reading detailed information on products with NFC chips.
- **NFC Trigger**: A feature-rich app for changing smartphone settings, launching apps, logging into social media, sending messages, and activating alarms.
